Part 0: Notice of Classification and Intent

   0.1. License Classification. This document constitutes a "Source-Available
   License with Social Use Restrictions." It is intentionally drafted to be
   incompatible with the definitions of "Open Source" as provided by the Open
   Source Initiative (OSI) and "Free Software" as provided by the Free Software
   Foundation (FSF). This distinction is fundamental to the License's purpose
   and should not be obscured.

   0.2. Declaration of Primary Goal. The primary and overriding goal of this
   License is to establish and protect a digital commons. It seeks to ensure
   that technology created for social inclusion, empowerment, and accessibility
   remains perpetually available for those purposes. It achieves this by
   explicitly restricting direct commercial exploitation, particularly through
   scalable service models like Software as a Service (SaaS), which could
   otherwise transform the Work into a tool of economic exclusion. By using,
   modifying, or distributing this Work, You irrevocably agree to uphold these
   principles and adhere to the following restrictions.

Preamble: The Philosophy of the Social Commons

The vyAI Social Commons License (vSCL) is born from a simple yet resolute
conviction: technology designed to empower and include must never become a
barrier. This license governs software and other copyrightable works created
to serve communities, advance public education and research, support non-profit
organizations, and assist persons with disabilities. Its purpose is to carve
out a protected space—a digital commons—where essential tools remain freely
accessible for all socially beneficial applications.

This License grants broad permissions to use, study, modify, and share the
Work. It explicitly encourages the integration of the Work into physical
hardware products, recognizing that tangible innovation is a powerful means
of delivering technology to people's hands.

However, the License establishes a crucial ethical and legal boundary: the
Work itself cannot be sold or offered as a commercial service where access is
contingent on payment. This restriction is not intended to stifle all
commercial activity, but to ensure that any commercial activity centers
around physical delivery, human expertise, or ancillary support, rather than
monetizing access to the Work's core functionality itself.

For instance, a sophisticated AI-powered assistive reading system governed by
this License can be freely developed and deployed by public libraries,
rehabilitation centers, or NGOs serving communities with low digital literacy.
This License contractually protects this system from being appropriated by a
corporation that would rebrand it and charge a prohibitive monthly
subscription fee for the exact same service.

We believe that true innovation is measured by its service to humanity. This
License is our legal and philosophical commitment to that ideal, ensuring that
the fruits of our labor nurture social good, not just commercial profit. The
following terms and conditions are designed to enforce this philosophy with
maximum legal clarity and strength.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part I: Definitions

For the purposes of this License, the following terms shall have the meanings
specified below. These definitions are integral to the interpretation of Your
rights and obligations.

   1.1. "This License" refers to the vyAI Social Commons License, Version 1.2
   (Definitive Edition).

   1.2. "The Licensor" refers to the original copyright holder or the legal
   entity authorized by the copyright holder that is placing the Work under
   this License.

   1.3. "The Work" refers to any copyrightable material—including but not
   limited to software in Source Code or Object Code form, documentation,
   datasets, specifications, and machine learning models (including weights
   and architecture)—that the Licensor has explicitly designated as being
   governed by this License.

   1.4. "You" (or "Your") refers to an individual or a legal entity exercising
   the permissions granted by this License.

   1.5. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Work for making
   modifications. This includes all modules, associated interface definition
   files, scripts controlling compilation and installation, and any other
   documentation necessary to understand, modify, and reproduce the Work.

   1.6. "To Modify" means to create a "Derivative Work" by copying from or
   adapting all or part of the Work in a manner requiring copyright
   permission.

   1.7. "Derivative Work" means any work based on or derived from the Work.
   This includes translations, adaptations, and any other form in which the
   Work may be recast or transformed. For the purposes of this License, a
   Derivative Work also includes any other work that integrates with the Work
   so intimately—whether through static linking, dynamic linking, or tight API
   coupling—that it cannot reasonably be considered an independent work.

   1.8. "To Propagate" and "To Convey" have the same meaning as in the GNU
   General Public License version 3. To "Propagate" is to do anything that
   would make You liable for copyright infringement without permission, except
   for private modification or execution. To "Convey" is any propagation that
   enables others to receive copies.

   1.9. "Permitted Social Purpose" refers to any use of the Work that is not a
   Prohibited Commercial Offering and is conducted by or for:

      a) Non-Profit and Charitable Organizations: Use by or for legally
      registered non-profit, charitable, or public-benefit organizations (e.g.,
      a foundation providing digital literacy tools).

      b) Educational Use: Non-commercial activities within academic
      institutions (schools, universities) for teaching, learning, and academic
      research (e.g., a university computer science course using the Work as a
      case study).

      c) Public Research: Research by individuals or institutions where all
      results, data, and conclusions are made publicly available under terms
      that do not restrict access.

      d) Personal, Hobbyist, and Community Projects: Use by individuals or
      informal community groups for projects not intended for commercial gain
      or to support a commercial enterprise (e.g., a group of volunteers
      building a local community information kiosk).

      e) Accessibility Projects: The development and deployment of tools or
      services specifically intended to assist persons with disabilities,
      provided these tools themselves are not offered as a Prohibited
      Commercial Offering.

   1.10. "Prohibited Commercial Offering" means making the core functionality
   of the Work, or a Derivative Work, available to third parties in a way that
   generates revenue by charging for access to the Work's features. This
   prohibition applies regardless of the delivery mechanism and includes, but
   is not limited to:

      a) Software as a Service (SaaS): Hosting the Work and charging users a
      fee for access, particularly when such access is monetized in a way that
      effectively denies individuals or communities equitable access to the Work.
      This clause shall be interpreted broadly, focusing on the effect of the
      offering on user access, not merely its technical implementation.

      b) Platform as a Service (PaaS): Providing a development or deployment
      platform that incorporates the Work as a core, monetized component that
      other developers build upon for a fee.

      c) API as a Service: Charging a fee for programmatic access to the Work's
      functionality via an Application Programming Interface (API).

      d) Direct Sale or Licensing: Selling, renting, leasing, or sublicensing
      the Work or a Derivative Work as a standalone software product.

   1.11. "Permitted Hardware Product" refers to a tangible, physical hardware
   device that is sold to an end-user and which incorporates the Work. For a
   product to qualify, it must meet all of the following conditions:

      a) Substantial Independent Value: The hardware itself must possess
      substantial functionality, value, and complexity independent of the Work.
      The Work must not be the sole or primary element of value. (e.g., A
      consumer robot where the Work manages one of its sensor arrays, but the
      product's primary value lies in its mechanical construction, motors,
      battery system, and other onboard software).

      b) Integrated Feature: The Work must function as an integrated and
      supporting component, not as the primary marketed feature.

      c) Hardware-Centric Transaction: The marketing, sale, and pricing of the
      product must be clearly centered on the physical device. The cost to the
      end-user must not be framed or itemized as a license fee for the Work.

   1.12. "Ancillary Services" refers to professional services based on human
   expertise, for which You may charge a fee. This includes providing
   installation, technical support, training, or consulting related to the Work.
   Offering Ancillary Services does not violate this License, provided the
   service does not function as a proxy for a Prohibited Commercial Offering.

Part II: Core Permissions and Scope

   2.1. Grant of License. Subject to Your strict adherence to all terms and
   conditions of this License, the Licensor grants You a worldwide,
   royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration
   of the copyright) license to:

      a) Use the Work for any Permitted Social Purpose.

      b) Use the Work for internal evaluation, research, and development within
      any organization, including for-profit corporations, provided such use
      does not result in a Prohibited Commercial Offering.

      c) Create and Modify the Work to produce Derivative Works.

      d) Reproduce and Convey verbatim copies of the Work's Source Code.

      e) Convey Derivative Works, but only under the conditions mandated in
      Part III.

Part III: Conditions on Distribution (Social Commons Copyleft)

   3.1. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may Convey verbatim copies of the Work’s
   Source Code as You receive it, in any medium, provided that You conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice; maintain
   all notices referring to this License and to the disclaimer of warranty; and
   provide a full copy of this License to all recipients.

   3.2. Conveying Derivative Works. You may Convey a Derivative Work, but only
   under the following mandatory conditions:

      a) You must fulfill all obligations listed in Section 3.1.

      b) The Derivative Work must carry prominent notices stating that You
      modified it, with a relevant date.

      c) The Derivative Work as a whole must be licensed under this License.
      You must ensure that anyone who comes into possession of a copy receives
      a license to the entire work under these same terms. This obligation is
      absolute and applies to all parts of the Derivative Work, regardless of
      how they are packaged.

Part IV: Restrictions and Exemptions

   4.1. Absolute Prohibition on Commercial Offerings. To be unmistakably clear:
   You may not, under any circumstance, use the Work or any Derivative Work, in
   whole or in part, to create, support, or offer a Prohibited Commercial
   Offering as defined in Section 1.10. This is the central, non-negotiable
   restriction of this License.

   4.2. Guiding Principle for Interpretation. In any case of ambiguity regarding
   whether a specific use case constitutes a Prohibited Commercial Offering, the
   interpretation that best serves the License's stated goal of protecting the
   Work for the digital commons and preventing its transformation into a tool of
   economic exclusion shall prevail.

   4.3. Explicitly Permitted Commercial Activities. Notwithstanding the
   prohibition in Section 4.1, the following are not considered violations:

      a) Sale of Permitted Hardware Products: You may manufacture and sell
      Permitted Hardware Products as defined in Section 1.11.

      b) Provision of Ancillary Services: You may charge fees for providing
      Ancillary Services as defined in Section 1.12.

Part V: Standard Legal Provisions

   5.1. Termination. Your rights under this License terminate automatically and
   immediately if You fail to comply with any of its terms. If You cease all
   violations, Your license is reinstated provisionally unless and until the
   Licensor explicitly terminates it, and permanently if the Licensor fails to
   notify You of the violation within 60 days of Your cessation.

   5.2. Acceptance. You are not required to accept this License to receive or
   run a copy of the Work. However, nothing else grants You permission to
   Propagate or Modify it. By undertaking these actions, You indicate Your
   unconditional acceptance of all terms and conditions herein.

   5.3. NO WARRANTY. THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

   5.4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR
   ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
   TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR
   THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.

   5.5. Severability and Interpretation. If any provision of this License is
   held to be unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. The Preamble, Notices, and Definitions are
   integral parts of this License and must be used in its interpretation.

   obligations.

APPENDIX A: Practical Examples and Scenarios

This appendix is for informational purposes and does not replace the legally
binding terms above.

   Scenario 1: The Non-Profit Foundation (Permitted)
      Action: A foundation for digital inclusion downloads the Work, modifies
      it to better suit local languages, and deploys it on free-to-use
      terminals in community centers.
      Verdict: Permitted. This is a clear example of a "Permitted Social Purpose."

   Scenario 2: The Hardware Startup (Permitted)
      Action: A startup designs and builds an advanced robotic arm for use in
      physical therapy. The Work is used to control the arm's fine motor
      movements. They sell the robotic arm for $5,000.
      Verdict: Permitted. This is a "Permitted Hardware Product." The value is
      in the hardware, and the Work is an integrated component.

   Scenario 3: The SaaS Company (Prohibited)
      Action: A tech company takes the Work, hosts it on its cloud servers,
      and sells API access to other developers at $0.01 per call.
      Verdict: Prohibited. This is a textbook "Prohibited Commercial Offering"
      (SaaS/API as a Service) and a direct violation of Section 4.1.

   Scenario 4: The IT Consulting Firm (Permitted)
      Action: A consulting firm charges a corporate client $10,000 to install,
      configure, and integrate the Work into the client's internal document
      management system. The client does not offer this system to external
      users as a service.
      Verdict: Permitted. The consulting firm is selling "Ancillary Services"
      (human expertise). The client is using the work for "Internal Business Use."
      Neither is a violation.

   Scenario 5: The "Freemium Wrapper" (Prohibited)
      Action: A company offers a "free" online service that is a thin wrapper
      around the Work's functionality. However, to unlock essential features
      (like saving files or handling larger inputs), users must upgrade to a "Pro"
      plan for $15/month.
      Verdict: Prohibited. This is an attempt to circumvent the SaaS
      restriction. The service's core value is derived from the Work, and its
      access is monetized. This violates the spirit and letter of the License.
